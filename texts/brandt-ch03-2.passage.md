今厚而無竅。則不能剖以盛物。
Now (that gourd of yours) is thick but has no cavity; therefore it can not be made to hold things.

屈穀曰。今君仰人而食亦無益於人國。殆堅匏之類也。
Ch'ü-ku replied, "Living now at other people's expense you are also of no use to their state and (therefore) closely resemble the hard bottle-gourd (lit. nearly of the hard bottle-gourd class).
`a_name-a_name (Ch'\ü\-ku) said[:replied], "^now you 3rely[ing]_upon 4person[:other_people] [and are] 2conjunctive_particle (by) 1eat[:feed_yourself] also [of] without[:no] advantage (use) to person[:their] state [and therefore] 2nearly 4hard 5bottle\-gourd ~'s[:~] 3[of the same] class [as the] 1final_particle[:are]."`
