<center>THE COMPARATIVE PARTICLES.</center>

The following are the particles which are used in comparative constructions.

### A. Single particles:

<center>`比` `較` `於` `平`</center>

The single particles are used when two or many objects are compared and when one object is represented as more preferable to another or many others. The meaning of these particles corresponds to the English "than".

### B. Compound particles:

<center>`寧`...`不` (or `莫`) `寧可` `不可` `與其` `不如` (or `莫如`, `不若`, `何如`, `寧`)</center>

The compound particles are used when two actions or states are compared and when one of them is represented as more preferable.

The combinations:

<center>`寧`...`不` or `寧可`, `不可`</center>

mean: "it is better... than".

The combinations:

<center>`與其` `不如` (or `莫如`, `不若`, `何如`, `寧`)</center>

mean: "as compared with... it is better (or 'there is nothing equal' etc.)"

When it is only stated that an object, state or action is more preferable without comparing it with any other, the particles: `不如` `不若`, `寧`, are used. These particles correspond to the English expressions: "better", "it is better".
