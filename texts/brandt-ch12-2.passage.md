B 公使致外交總長函
A Letter from a Foreign Minister to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

逕啟者。前因本署某官。擬赴陝西遊歷。當由本公便函請貴總長。繕給護照一張。
As an official of our Legation was intending to go into Shensi for travel, I sent a letter asking (lit. it was asked by me by letter) Your Excellency to have a passport prepared (for him).

尙未動身。現接本國外交部電開。飭令該員。迅即回國。等因前來。進此。
(But) before he started (lit. he has not yet started), a telegram was received from our Foreign Office ordering him to return home at once.

所有該員赴陝一舉。自應中止。
Naturally the matter of the trip of the said official into Shensi must be dropped.

茲將原領護照一紙送上。即希貴總長查照註銷可也。
Now, I beg to return the originally received passport which I hope Your Excellency will note and duly cancel.

此泐。順頌時祉。
I avail myself, etc.
