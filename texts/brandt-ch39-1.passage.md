President Ts'ao-Ku'n's Telegram of Resignation

北京十三年十月之國務院。參眾兩院。各省區軍
民長官。各省省議會。各法團。各報館。轉全國公民
公鑒。

錕泰膺重托。德薄能鮮。致令部曲橋貳紀綱失墜。

國務院自當復政。依法攝行大總統職務。

I am ashamed that I have not been able to control the situation, and it is not to clamor about my own merits that I resign (my post). My intention is only to retire into private life in order to reflect upon my faults in solitude.
