<!-- The Tiger of Chao-Ch'eng
There lived at Chao-ch'eng an old woman more than seventy years of age She had an only son. One day he went up into the mountains and was devoured by a tiger. The sorrow of his mother was so great that she almost (絲) wished to die (lit. 成 did not wish to live). Weeping and wailing she (wert) to the local district magistrate and brought an accusation (against the tiger). The magistrate laughed and said, "How could a tiger be controlled by the law!" But the old woman went on weeping.
and it was impossible to stop (her lamentations). The magis- trate hooted at her, but she did not pay any attention (lit. was not afraid). Then the magistrate in compassion for her great age did not wish to intimidate her and promised her to have the tiger arrested. (However) the old woman still lay prostrate on the ground and would not go until the warrant had been issued. The magistrate, having no other choice 【無奈 ), asked his attendants which of them would take up the job (lit. to go). One of them, named Li-Neng, who happened to be drunk, stepped up to his seat (坐下) and declared that he could do it. Whereupon the warrant was issued, and then() the old woman went away. When Li-Neng got sober he was sorry (j) for what had happened (之). But (猶) re-
flecting that it was a mere trick the magistrate had played on the old woman in order to get rid of her, he did not care much about it and handed back the warrant to the magistrate. The latter cried angrily, "You said you could do this, and now I will not allow you to return the warrant." I.i-Neng very muclı annoyed asked him for a warrant ordering to impress the (local) huntsmen. The magistrate granted it to him, and Li-Neng, having collected the huntsmen, lay in ambush day and night in the hills hoping to catch a tiger and thus to make an appearance of having performed his duty.
