郄監 Ch'i Chian of the Chin (晉) dynasty sent an emissary to the family of Wang-Tao (王導) to seek for a son-in-law. The emissary returned and said that all the sons were young and good-looking, but were rather too stiff, excepting one who was lying on a couch to the East (東床) with his stomach uncovered (坦腹), eating cakes in the most unconcerned manner. Ch'i-Chien exclaimed, "He will make an excellent son-in-law," and ultimately gave his daughter in marriage to the man who was no other than 王羲之 Wang Hsi-Chih, the famous calligrapher. Thence a son-in-law is called 東床 or 坦腹 (vid. Ch. Q., p. 150,- 1).
