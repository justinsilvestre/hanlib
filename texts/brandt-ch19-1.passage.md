聊齋誌異 妖術(續)
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Magical Arts (continued)

公方駭。鬼則彎矢。公以劍撥矢。矢墮。
Yu was startled, and the demon discharged an arrow. Yü warded off the arrow with his sword, and it dropped.

欲擊之。則又彎矣。
Yü was going to strike the demon, who discharged another arrow.

公急躍避。矢貫於壁。戰戰有聲。
Yü quickly jumped aside to avoid it, and the arrow struck the wall where it stuck quivering.

鬼怒甚。拔佩刀揮如風。望公力劈。
The demon became furious, pulled out his sword and whirled it like the wind intending to give him a tremendous blow.

公猱進。刀中庭石。石立斷。
Yü ducked, and the sword struck the stone ledge cutting it in two.

公出其股間。削鬼中踝。鏗然有聲。
Yü sprang between the demon's legs and began hacking at his ankles. There was the sound of ringing blows.

鬼益怒。吼如雷。轉身復剁。
The demon, still more furious, roared like thunder and turned round to chop again at Yü.

公又伏身入。刀落斷公裙。
Yü again crouched and passed between the demon's legs. The blade fell and cut off a piece of Yü's skirt.

公已及脅下。猛斫之。亦鏗然有聲。
Yü reached its side and hacked fiercely with the same ringing sound.

鬼仆而僵。公亂擊之。聲硬如栎燭之。
The demon fell down and became rigid. Yü hit at it wildly, and it sounded hard like a watchman's rattle.

則一木偶。高大如人。弓矢尙纏腰際。刻書猙獰。
Turning the light on (he found) it was a wooden idol as tall as a man, with a bow and arrows attached to the waist, and carved and painted in a hideous fashion.

劍擊處。皆有血。
Wherever the sword had struck, there was blood.

公因秉燭待旦。方悟鬼物皆卜人遣之。欲致人於死。以神其術也。
Yü held the candle in his hand till dawn, and then he realized that the demons were all sent by the diviner, intending to bring about his death and so manifest his own magic art.

次日偏告交知。與共詣卜所。
The next day Yü told the story to all his friends and went with them to the diviner's house.

卜人遙見公。瞥不可見。
The latter saw him coming from a distance and made himself invisible.

或曰。此翳形術也。犬血可破。
Some one said this was a trick of rendering oneself invisible, and the charm could be dispelled with dog's blood.

公如言。戒備而往。
Yü accordingly procured some dog's blood and went back (to the diviner's house).

卜人又匿如前。急以犬血沃立處。
Again the diviner disappeared as before, but Yü scattered the blood on the place where he had been standing.

但見卜人頭面。皆爲犬血模糊。目灼灼如鬼立。
The diviner's head and face appeared blurred with blood, his eyes glaring like a demon's.

乃執付有司而殺之。
Thereupon they seized him and turned him over to the civil authorities who put him to death.
