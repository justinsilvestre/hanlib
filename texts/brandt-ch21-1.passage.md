聊齋誌異 勞山道士 (續)
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - The Taoist Priest of Lao-shan Mountain (continued)

俄一客曰。蒙賜月明之照。乃爾寂飲。何不呼嫦娥來。
Suddenly one of the guests said, "We sit here enjoying the moonlight. But we drink alone. Why not call up Ch'ang-E?"

乃以箸擲月中。見一美人。自光中出。初不盈尺。至地。遂與人等。
Whereupon he threw a chopstick into the moon, and they saw a beautiful girl coming forth from the light, at first not more than a foot high; but on touching the ground she became as tall as a man.

纖腰秀項。翩翩作霓裳舞。
She had a slender waist and a beautiful neck and fluttered gracefully in the "Colored Garment" dance.

已而歌曰。仙仙乎。而還乎。而幽我於廣寒乎。其聲清越。烈如簫管。
When the dance was finished, she sang, "Fairies! Fairies! Do you return? Do you intend to send me (back) to my (lonely) palace of the moon?" Her voice was clear sonorous and ringing like a flute.

歌畢。盤旋而起。躍登儿上。驚顧之間。已復爲箸。三人大笑。
At the end of the song she turned round, jumped up on the table and before the astonished eyes of all, became again a chopstick. The three friends laughed loudly.

又一客曰。今宵最樂。然不勝酒力矣。其錢我於月宮。可乎。
Another guest said, "This evening we are very happy, but we have drunk enough. Let us take a parting drink in the palace of the moon!"

三人移席。漸入月中。眾視三人。坐月中飲。鬚眉畢見。如影之在鏡中。
So the three moved their feast, and gradually walked into the moon, where all saw them sitting and drinking, their beards and eyebrows plainly seen as though reflected in a mirror.

移時月漸暗。門人然燭來。則道士獨坐而客杏矣。几上肴核尙存。壁上月。紙圓如鏡而己。
After a while the moon darkened. The disciples brought lighted candles, and found the priest sitting alone. The guests had disappeared. Viands were still upon the table. The moon on the wall was merely a paper, round like a mirror.

道士問眾飲足乎。曰足矣。足宜早寝。勿惧樵蘇。衆諾而退。王竊忻慕。歸念遂息。
"Has everybody had enough to drink?" asked the priest. "Quite enough" replied the disciples. "In that case", (said the priest), "you had better retire early so as not to be late for the fuel gathering (to-morrow morning)". And so they retired. Wang was very much pleased, and all his longing for home was forgotten.

又一月。苦不可忍。而道士並不傳教一術。心不能待。
Another month passed, and the hardships became unbearable. Moreover the priest had not taught him any magical skill, and he could stand it no longer.

辭曰。弟子數百里受業仙師。縱不能得長生術。或小有傳習。亦可慰求教之心。
(Therefore) he took his leave saying, "I have come many miles to receive your instructions. Though I cannot obtain the secret of immortality, still if I should receive instruction in some minor art, it also would satisfy my cravings for knowledge.

今開兩三月。不過早樵而暮歸。弟子在家未請此苦。
In these two or three months just passed, there has been nothing but going out early to gather fuel and returning in the evening. At home I have not been accustomed to these hardships."
