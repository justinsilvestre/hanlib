送友人土物信
A Letter on Sending Local Products to a Friend

某某仁兄大人閣下敬啟者。
To the Honorable Mr. So-And-So, from So-And-So.

梧桐葉落。天下知秋。
The leaves of the parasol tree fall, and all under heaven know it is autumn.

弟昨日蒞都。滿擬造府拜晤。
Yesterday, I arrived in the capital and intended to visit your residence.

奈因沿路感受風寒。微覺不爽。
Unfortunately, due to the cold wind along the way, I was feeling slightly unwell.

必須調養數日。
I must recuperate for a few days.

容俟少痊。即當走候。
As soon as I recover a little, I will come to visit.

茲遣小價送上土產數種。聊表私懷。
For now, I am sending several local products, just as a token of my feelings.

即希莞納。勿却是荷。
I hope you will happily accept them, and please do not decline them.

專泐肅柬。敬候福安。
That concludes this short letter, and I hope you are well.

餘容面罄。臨書依依。
When we meet, we can talk more. I think of you fondly as I write this.

並希原宥。是幸。
Additionally, I hope you will forgive me. I shall be most grateful.

弟某某鞠躬
I, So-And-So, bow to you.
