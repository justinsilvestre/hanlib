`[^the] go-person (traveller) and [the] donkey-man (donkey\-boy) collectively (both) pursue[:rushed_after] him [but could] not catch [him], [and] 2vexed-mourn (low\-spirited[:in_low_spirits]) conjunctive_particle[:~] 1return[ed].`

故曰。爭虛者喪其實。
For this reason it is said: "He who quarrels about nothing (lit. empty things) may lose something substantial."
`^therefore speak[:it_is_said], "2contest (quarrel[s]_about) 3empty (vain[_matters]) [may] 1one_who[:^he_who] lose 2[of] his 1genuine[:something_substantial]."`
