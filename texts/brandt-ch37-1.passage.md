國會政治之危險 (續)
The Danger for the Parliamentary System (continued)

次觀察義國。獨裁首相莫索利尼何故出現乎。
Let us look next at Italy. Why has dictator Mussolini appeared (there)?

是無他。蓋義國國民見其國會政治之麻痺萎頓。達至失望。
It was for no other reason than that the Italian people seeing their parliamentary government lifeless and broken down came to lose all hope in it.

國王政黨官僚。均茫然自失。一時將陷於無政府狀態。
The king, the political parties and officials were all perplexed and completely at a loss, and (the country) was for a moment on the point of falling into a state of anarchy.

惟此際因國民不喜赤化。途至歡迎莫索利尼之獨裁政治。
Just at this time, since the people did not desire bolshevism, they (accordingly) welcomed the dictatorship of Mussolini.

郎德國與法國亦決非擇獨裁政治者。不過因惑於國會政治之失敗。欲藉獨裁政治以免無政府狀態已耳。
Now Germany and France certainly do not prefer dictatorship and only on account of the failure of the parliamentary government would they accept dictatorship in order to avoid anarchy.

再觀察法國。其內閣在二年間曾四度更迭。基礎常動搖。小黨林立。政策不得安定其財政政策。尤爲內閣動搖之大原因。
Again let us look at France. Within two years her cabinet has been changed four times. As the foundation of the government is being constantly shaken, and small political parties are very numerous, the government policy is unable to be stabilized. The financial policy is particularly the cause of this constant instability of the cabinet.

蓋法國由經濟上言之頗爲繁榮。不似英德兩國發生失業問題。惟政治機關痲痺。不易解决財政上之困難。
From the point of view of economics France is in a flourishing condition, not like England and Germany where the problem of unemployment nas arisen. It is only because the government is powerless, that the financial difficulties are not easily settled.

因此國民日益不信任其政治機關。在歐洲諸國中。以法人民爲最熟知獨裁政治之害。
For this reason the French people are daily losing faith in their government machinery. Of all European countries the French know most thoroughly the harm of dictatorship.

然亦不得不痛感獨裁政治。聞法軟弱無能之政治。聞法人中亦有景慕莫索利尼者。此非無故也。
However they are obliged to admit that a dictatorship is better than a weak and powerless government. One hears that among the French there are also many admirers of Mussolini, and that is not without reason.
