## Grammatical section.

<center>THE EXCLAMATORY PARTICLES.</center>

The exclamatory particles are used to express admiration, surprise, delight, lamentation, etc. and to form questions when a negative of the proposition conveyed is implied.

These particles are: `與` (or `歟`) `也與` `乎` `乎哉` `哉` `豈`.

`乎` used in the middle of a sentence serves sometimes as an expletive (ex. 13, 14, 15, 16). `乎` joined with `已矣` forms an exclamation of lamentation: "alas!" "it is all over!" (ex. 11, 12).

`哉` is often used in the middle of a sentence after individual words giving a strong emphasis to them (ex. 18, 19, 20). `哉` and `乎` are also used in combination with the interrogative particles to complete interrogative clauses (see lesson XXIII, gram. section, ex. 5, 6, 8, 41, 53).

`豈` is sometimes used alone, sometimes in combination with `乎`, `哉` or `與` put at the end of a clause (ex. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27). The particles `與`, `也與` and `乎` are also used as interrogative particles to express ordinary questions (see lesson XXIII, gram. section).

### Examples of using the exclamatory particles:
