<!-- CHINA CAN GET STRONG AT THE PRESENT TIME ONLY BY RECTIFYING THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE (continued). If the time comes when foreigners will treat us (加於 五人) with the same methods (手段) they used in colonizing India, Korea and Africa, then even if () we wish to rise and oppose them, it is to be feared that our constitution will have been wasted and our spirit worn out, and like those of a sick man will not be able longer to be of use (to us). Such is the re- sult of a selfish policy under pretense of doing the people's will. If they say, "Such is Heaven's will",-it would be still more wrong. There is (in the works of Mencius) the saying, "Heaven sees according as the people see; Heaven hears according as the people hear". It means that Heaven's will is also based on the people's will. As mean factious people, they usually seize high official posts appropriate large emoluments and use to their advantage men of no intelligence and foolish youngsters. They set their hearts upon wealth and honor and ruin the country. Their hearts are so rotten and corrupt that even dogs and horses will not feed on them. While they covet the glory of heaven for their own ends they brew for their country unending calamity and bring China to complete ruin. Such is the result which a selfish heart can bring about, and it should be a matter of the most careful con- cern for all who are responsible for the government of present day irrespective of political parties. With regard(至若) to the four classes of to-day, the literati are the most boisterous and boastful. Even before they assume office (尙未出任) they have already a heart bent on gain and big salaries, wealth and honor, giving thought as to how they may establish their own friends (私人) in positions and get what they like. All these unlawful thoughts have
their roots ) in (their) vicious natures. Should we desire (根株) them to do right we could not get it. The farmers, laborers and merchants are not lacking (不 5) in men of high ideals and right hearts; still (m) there are many individuals (among them) whose hearts are of the most vicious nature. Although my knowledge and experience are limited, still (惟) among the conditions of the present social order I see everywhere traps and snares set up to entrap the upright, openly or in secret. People have become venomous wasps, and (all this) makes one sad at heart. What plan is there left open to us? Excepting the rectifying of the people's heart there is no other way for us to become strong. And it is for this reason that I have written the present article. My words have been drawn at random, and I realize that I have incurred the scorn of the wise and the ridicule of the refined. Still looking at China to- day (one sees that) only by rectifying the heart of the people can she become strong. You, the elite of society, what is your cpinion?

中國今日自强在正人心論 (續)
China can get strong at the present time only by rectifying the heart of the people (continued)

至外人以印度朝鮮非洲殖民之手沒加於吾人時。吾人即欲起而反抗。恐元氣已耗。精華已竭。有若病夫。無能爲役。
If the time comes when foreigners will treat us with the same methods they used in colonizing India, Korea, and Africa, then even if we wish to rise and oppose them, it is to be feared that our constitution will have been wasted and our spirit worn out, and like those of a sick man will not be able longer to be of use (to us).

此乃假借民意而行私意之結果也。如日天意。尤屬妄爲。
Such is the result of a selfish policy under pretense of doing the people's will. If they say, "Such is Heaven's will," it would be still more wrong.

書曰。天視自我民視。天聽自我民聽。是天意亦以民意爲歸宿。
There is (in the works of Mencius) the saying, "Heaven sees according as the people see; Heaven hears according as the people hear." It means that Heaven's will is also based on the people's will.

荒誕小人。平素竊據高官厚祿。利用無知識及童錶之輩。覬覦富貴。破人家國。
As mean factitious people, they usually seize high official posts, appropriate large emoluments, and use to their advantage men of no intelligence and foolish youngsters. They set their hearts upon wealth and honor and ruin the country.

心術臭壞。犬馬不食。貪天功以爲己利。將釀無窮之禍端。置中國於滅種而後已。
Their hearts are so rotten and corrupt that even dogs and horses will not feed on them. While they covet the glory of heaven for their own ends, they brew for their country unending calamity and bring China to complete ruin.

此私心之結果。亦今日爲政者無論任何黨派。所應警惕者也。
Such is the result which a selfish heart can bring about, and it should be a matter of the most careful concern for all who are responsible for the government of present day irrespective of political parties.

至若今之四民。爲士者囂張過甚。尙未出任。已懷利祿富貴之心。當若何。位置私人也。予取予求也。
With regard to the four classes of today, the literati are the most boisterous and boastful. Even before they assume office, they have already a heart bent on gain and big salaries, wealth and honor, giving thought as to how they may establish their own friends in positions and get what they like.

種種不法思想。根株於劣根性。欲其爲善。豈可得乎。
All these unlawful thoughts have their roots in (their) vicious natures. Should we desire to root them out, we could not get it.

農工商志高心正者。固不乏其人。而心術極壞者亦實繁有徒。
The farmers, laborers, and merchants are not lacking in men of high ideals and right hearts; still there are many individuals among them whose hearts are of the most vicious nature.

余知識淺陋。惟觀近年社會現狀。到處佈滿陷阱。惨害正人。或明或暗。
Although my knowledge and experience are limited, still among the conditions of the present social order, I see everywhere traps and snares set up to entrap the upright, openly or in secret.

人類變成蜂躉。是誠令人心哀。
People have become venomous wasps, and all this makes one sad at heart.

有何有法。非正人心。則不能自强。
What plan is there left open to us? Excepting the rectifying of the people's heart, there is no other way for us to become strong.

放著此論。狂言之甚。知不免明哲之護。大雅之龍。
And it is for this reason that I have written the present article. My words have been drawn at random, and I realize that I have incurred the scorn of the wise and the ridicule of the refined.

然則中國現狀。非正人心則不能自强。邦人君子以爲如何乎。
Still looking at China today, only by rectifying the heart of the people can she become strong. You, the elite of society, what is your opinion?
