聊齋誌異 勞山道士 (續)
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - The Taoist Priest of Lao-shan Mountain (continued)

道土笑曰。我固謂不能作苦。今果然。明早當遣汝行。
The priest laughingly said, "I certainly told you, you could not endure hardships, and to-day it is proved. To-morrow early I will send you home".

王曰。弟子操作多日。師略授小技。此來爲不負也。
“I have worked for you," replied Wang, "many days. Will you not impart a little of your skill, that my coming may not have been in vain”.

道士問何術之求。曰。每見師行處。牆壁所不能隔。但得此法足矣。
"For what do you ask?" asked the priest. Wang replied, "I have noticed that wherever you go, walls are no obstacle to you. To learn only that secret would be enough."

道士笑而允之。乃傳以訣。令自咒畢。呼曰入之。
The priest laughed and assented. Whereupon he taught Wang a formula and bade him recite.

王面牆不敢入。又曰。試入之。王果從容入。及牆而阻。
When he had done so, the priest shouted, "Go through it!" Wang facing the wall did not dare to move forward. "Try to enter it," said again the priest. Wang slowly advanced, reached the wall and was there stopped.

道士曰。俛首驟入。勿逡巡。王果去牆數步奔而入。及心。虛若無物。回視。果在牆外兔。
The priest said, "Hang your head down and enter quickly. Do not hesitate!" Wang took several steps from the wall and rushed at it. At the wall (it seemed to him) there was no wall and looking back he found himself outside.

大喜。入謝。道士曰。歸宜潔持。否則不騐遂資斧遣之。
Overjoyed he returned and expressed his gratitude (to the priest). "When you return home, you must be clean. Otherwise it will not be effective", said the priest. Then he gave Wang travelling expenses and sent him home.

歸抵家。自詡遇仙。堅壁所不能阻。妻不信。
At home Wang bragged that he had seen the immortals and that no wall was a barrier to him. His wife did not believe (his words).

王傚其作爲。去牆數尺。奔而入。頭觸硬壁。驀然而路。
(Thereupon) Wang repeated his (former) performance. He stepped back several steps from the wall and rushed at it at full speed. His head struck the hard wall and he fell down suddenly.

妻扶視之。額上墳起。如巨卵焉。妻揶揄之。王慚忿。駡道士無良而已。
His wife helped him up and looked at him. On his forehead was a lump as big as a large egg. His wife made fun of him, and Wang half ashamed half angry cursed the old priest calling him a wicked fellow.
