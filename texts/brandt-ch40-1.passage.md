臨時執政令
The (Farewell) Edict of the Chief Executive

民國成立十有五載紛亂迄無寧日。
Since the establishment of the Republic fifteen years ago internecine strife has prevailed without a single day of peace.

本執政蒞事以來。兢兢以振導和平與民更始爲念。
Since I assumed office as Chief Executive I have been striving my best to lead (the country) to peace so as to make a new start with the people.

不圖德未足以感人。才未足以濟變。力不從心事俱違願。
Unfortunately (lit. unexpectedly) my virtues fail to win the respect of others, my ability is not sufficient to stop the rebellion, my strength is not equal to my will, and I have not been able to realize my expectations.

迭經聲述。期於退休。然猶不辭謗議。忍辱至今者。徒以民
國締構。本執政心力所存。休戚與共。
I have more than once expressed my desire to resign from office, but the reason why I still (do not retire) in spite of all abuses and insults, is that I have played no small part in the establishment of the Republic sharing all joys and sorrows with it.

內審時艱。外崇國信。且目睹赤化之禍流於首都。不敢遽爲無責任之放棄耳。
When I saw the internal difficulties of the country, the necessity of maintaining the national faith with the foreign Powers and the "red" danger to which the metropolitan district was exposed, I could not bear (lit. did not dare) to give up my office suddenly without a feeling of responsibility.

本月九日之亂。所關於國家紀綱軍人職責者絕鉅。遴茲奇變。內疚尤深。
The "coup d'etat" of the 9th of this month seriously affects the laws of the country and the duty of military men, and my heart is filled with sorrow at this sudden change.

義者臨時政府開始之日。曾規定應辦者若干事。一年之中。事勢扞格。
Formerly, when the Provisional Government was first established, I planned a number of affairs to be carried out, but in the course of one year I was hindered (in my plans) by the force of circumstances.

今後是否按程繼進。聽諸公意。
Whether (the Government) will proceed (with these plans) in the future depends upon public opinion.

遡來宗國元功。方隅諸帥。壓以大計相與詢謀。國家之福有目共見。
It is significant for the future prosperity of the country that recently many elder statesmen and military leaders have begun to talk over among themselves fundamental plans (for the salvation of the country).

當此亂極思治之秋。不無貞下起元之會。
At the present juncture when disorders have reached an extreme point and everybody is longing for order, there may be a good opportunity for the improvement of affairs.

其速妥議善後。俾國政不至中斬。
Let them quickly decide measures for rehabilitation, so that there will be no interruption of governmental business.

僉謀朝同。初服夕具。
If all agree in the morning, I will retire in the evening.

本執政從容修省。得爲海濱一民。終其餘年。所欣慕焉。
All I desire is that I may be able to spend the rest of my life as a plain citizen of the Republic in quiet self meditation.
