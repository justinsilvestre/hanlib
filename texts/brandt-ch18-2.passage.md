A 外交部致駐法胡公使電 三年一月二十九日
A Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Mr. Hu-Wei-te (胡維德), the Chinese Minister at Paris. 29th day, Ist month, 3rd year of the Republic.

修改稅則事。法康使覆稱政府令。如得相當酬報。可允酌改。並俟革命損失賠償公平了結後。方可接議等語。
With reference to the question of Tariff revision, the French Minister Mr. Conty has replied that his Goverment has instructed him to the effect that if a suitable compensation can be obtained, a modification of the Tariff may be granted and that further negotiation must be delayed until the compensation for losses and damages caused by the Revolution shall have been fairly settled, etc.

查修改稅則。係按約應辦之事。現已有七國覆文照允。法國不應藉此。別有要求。
The revision of the Tariff is a thing incumbent (upon the High Contracting Parties) according to treaty stipulations, and until now seven countries have replied in the affirmative. France should not take this as an excuse for making other demands.

除駁覆外。希聲請法政府。按約辦理。速爲允行。不再附帶條件。是爲至盼。
Besides refuting (this statement) you are requested to declare to the French Government that it should give its assent, in accordance with treaty stipulations, as soon as possible and without any conditions attached thereto. Kindly reply. Wai-chiao-pu.

B 駐法胡公使復外交部 電三年二月八日
A Telegram from Mr. Hu-wei-te, the Chinese Minister at Paris, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 8th day, 2nd month, 3rd year of the Republic.

稅則事。二十九日電悉。
Your telegram of the 29th regarding the Tariff question was noted.

面商外部。切請按約速議。告以如法能先他國開議。方見格外交誼。豈可藉此。別有要求。
In my interview with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs I earnestly requested him to consent to the negotiations in accordance with treaty stipulations as soon as possible, stating that if France should begin negotiations with China ahead of all the other Powers, she would show her special friendship towards China, and she should not (lit. how could she) take this as an excuse for extra demands.

伊稱伊必竭力贊成。但焙欸未結。恐被議院詰問。
He states, he will wholeheartedly assist in the matter, but fears that, with the question of compensations unsettled, the Parliament may raise questions.

駁以此另是一案。不應牽涉。伊允稍遲再復。
I have refuted (his statement) by saying that this (question) is another case and should not be associated (with the Tariff case), and he promised to answer a little later. Hu-Wei-te.
