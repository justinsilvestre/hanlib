高瓊
Kao-ch'iung

宋真宗時。契丹入寇。指揮使高瓊。請帝渡河禦寇。帝不允。
In the time of the Sung emperor, Chen-tsung, the Kitans attacked (lit. entered to rob) (China). The commander in chief, Kao-ch'iung, urged the emperor to cross the river in order to oppose the enemies (lit. robbers). The emperor would not assent.

瓊爭之甚力。時宰臣馮拯。在旁呵之曰。
Kao-ch'iung (began) to argue with him (very) hotly. The prime minister Feng-cheng, who was standing beside (him), shouted at him:

高瓊何得無禮。
"Kao-ch'iung, how dare you disregard all etiquette!"

瓊怒曰。君以文章爲大臣。今虜騎充斥如此。猶責瓊無禮。
"You have secured the office of minister by (your) essays", replied Kao-ch'iung angrily, "now, when there are so many enemies (lit. mounted brigands), you blame me for lack of etiquette.

君何不賦詩一章。以退虜耶。馮拯語塞。
Why (then) do you not compose some (lit. a piece） verses in order to rout them?" Feng-cheng was struck speechless (with that reply).

眞宗乃從瓊言。至河北登城。張黃龍旗。
The emperor followed Kao-ch'iung's advice (lit. words), proceeded to the northern side of the river, ascended the wall, and (ordered) the yellow imperial (lit. dragon) banners to be displayed.

城下將士望見之。皆呼萬歲。氣勢百倍。遂擊契丹走之。
Officers and soldiers who were under the wall saw the emperor and greeted him enthusiastically. Their courage increased a hundred fold; they attacked the Kitans and drove them away.
