## Grammatical section

### THE INTERROGATIVE PARTICLES

The Wen-li style particularly abounds with the interrogative particles.

These particles are:

<center>`何` `與` (or `歟`) `也與` `諸` `焉` `盍` `奚` `孰` `詎` `安` `耶` `曷` `胡` `惡` `惡乎`</center>

The exclamatory particles `哉` and `乎` and the final particle `已` are often used in combination with the interrogative particles to complete interrogative clauses.

`乎` and `諸` are also used as the prepositional particles (see lesson XXIV gram. section, ex. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57).
