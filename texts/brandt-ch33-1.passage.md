中國今日自强在正人心論
China can get strong at the present time only by rectifying the heart of the people.

人心不正。萬事不舉。此有識者所公認。然則今日之人心如何。
It is recognized by men of experience that when a people's heart is not right, no undertaking can prosper. In what condition is the heart of the people at present, is a question difficult to answer.

識者竊謂。今日我國社會罪惡。與政治罪惡。皆已臻極度。
Experienced men are of the opinion that the evil of both our country's social order and its government regime has reached the utmost limit.

制造罪惡之原動力。皆爲知識階級以上之人物。
The moving force in producing this are men whose standing is above the intellectual classes.

學問與經驗。皆較人爲優。何爲而陷中國於水深火熱之中。此無他。私心之作用耳。
Why is it that with learning and experience much higher than that of other people they throw China into the midst of such deep waters and hot fires? It is nothing other than the actions of selfish hearts.

物質文明愈進步。道徳心愈薄弱。道徳心薄弱。私己心必重。佐之以權利。賜之以爪牙。則萬惡皆作。
The more materialistic culture advances, the weaker becomes virtue, and where virtue is weak, there selfishness becomes inevitably stronger. And when this kind of people are assisted by power and backed up by soldiers, every kind of evil is exploited and every crime committed.

萬罪叢生矣。掠奪歟。惨殺歟。侵擾也。破壞也。置全國於危亡之境地而後已。
Plunder and cruel murder, invasion and destruction reducing the whole country to the most desperate straits and almost to extinction.

民意而借口於民意。試問所作所爲。
Although it is not the people's will, yet they pretend (that all is being done) with the people's approval.

能件件披露於吾民之前乎。倘曰。民可使由之。不可使知之。若此專制之政。非民國所應爲。
Perhaps they may reply that "the people are only to be led (a path of action), but not to be made to understand (it)." But this kind of despotic regime is not proper for a republic.

寃成痛哉。吾國之民也。一心竞顧眼前燉飯爲要緊。不知監視奸賊。致爲少數國蠢所把持。
How wrong and how lamentable it is! Our people with their whole heart regard the provision of their daily bread as the matter of prime importance and they are not able (lit. do not know) to control such traitorous scoundrels, with the result that a small group of rapacious officials hold all the power in their hands.

一及覺悟。恐國賊早逍遙法外。
And when the people awake to the facts, those traitors will no doubt long ago have skipped beyond the reach of the law.

輕則數世之擔負加於吾民子子孫孫身上。重則談笑間斷送國脈於無影無形之中。
The result will be at best a burden added to the shoulders of our people, their sons and grandsons for many generations, and at worst with joke and smile (lit. in joyful chatter) the life of a nation thrown away into non-existence.
