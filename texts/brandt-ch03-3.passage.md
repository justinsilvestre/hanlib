## Grammatical section.

<center>PARTICLES OF THE WENLI STYLE.</center>

Even in the perusal of the first three lessons of the present course the reader could hardly have failed to notice the variety of so called "empty words" (`虚字`) let us call them "particles") and the important part they play in the structure of the written style.

The Chinese themselves pay no little attention to these particles, and there are many manuals on this subject in use in Chinese schools.

In the present course the particles are distributed in separate categories in accordance with their particular grammatical use.

### 1. `分量字` Particles of qualification (lit. of weight)

These particles indicate the degree of quality, state, or action, and are divided into the following four categories:

- a. `加等` The intensifying particles.
- b. `平等` The equalizing particles.
- c. `高等` The superlative particles.
- d. `低等` The limiting particles.

#### A. `加等` The intensifying particles.

Intensifying particles indicate the increase of the degree of quality, state, or action.

These particles are:

<center>`愈` `更` `益` `尤`</center>
