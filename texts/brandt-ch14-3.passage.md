趙且伐燕
The Intention of the Chao State to attack the State of Yen

趙且伐燕。蘇代爲燕謂惠王曰。今者臣來。過易水。蚌方出曝而鷸啄其肉。蚌合而箝其喙。
The Chao State was going to attack the Yen State. Su-tai on behalf of Yen said to prince Hui, "To-day, when coming (here), I crossed the river I, and saw an oyster which had just come out to warm itself in the sun. A kingfisher pecked at it (lit. its flesh). The oyster closed up its shell and jammed its beak.

鷸曰。今日不雨。明日不雨。即有死蚌。
The kingfisher said, "To-day it will not rain; to-morrow it will not rain, and there will be a dead oyster".

蚌亦謂鷸曰。今日不出。明日不出。即有死鷸。兩者不肯相舍。漁者得而幷擒之。
The oyster said in reply, "To-day you will not get off, tomorrow you will not get off, and there will be a dead kingfisher." Neither would let go of the other, and a fisherman took (that opportunity) and seized them both together.

今趙且伐燕。燕趙久相支。以弊大眾臣恐强秦之爲漁父也。故願王之熟計之也。
Now Chao intends to attack Yen. After a long fight both peoples will be exhausted (lit. Yen and Chao will fight a long time, so that all will be 'exhausted), and (then) I am afraid the strong State of Ch'in may prove to be the fisherman. I wish therefore that Your Majesty would think it over carefully".

惠王曰。善。乃止。
"Good", said the prince, and stopped (his preparations to attack Yen).
