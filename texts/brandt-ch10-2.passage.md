魏乳母
The Nurse from the Wei State

秦攻魏破之。
The Ch'in State attacked the Wei State and destroyed it.

魏公子亡大索不得。乃下令魏國曰。
The heir-apparent of the prince of Wei disappeared, and in spite of all efforts (lit. big searches) could not be found. Then the following order was issued throughout the Wei State:

有得公子者賞千金。匿者罪至族。
"He who will find the heir-apparent will be rewarded with one thousand ounces of silver. He who hides him will be punished with all his clan (lit. punishment reaches the clan)."

公子乳母與俱亡。
The nurse of the young prince had fled (together) with him.

或謂乳母曰。得公子賞甚重。乳母當知公子處。盡言之。
Someone told her, "There is a big reward for finding the prince. You must know the place (of his refuge). Why not tell it?"

乳母應之曰。我不知其處。雖知之。死則死。不可以言也。
"I do not know it," replied the nurse, "should I know it, even if I had to die I could not tell it.

凡養人子者。生之非務殺之也。
One who nurses another person's child takes care of his life, and by no means must let him die.

豈可以見利畏誅之故。廢義而行詐哉。
How could I for cupidity and for dread of death (lit. because I see the interest and am afraid of death) neglect my duty and commit treachery!

吾不能生。而使公子獨死矣。
I cannot remain alive and let the prince die alone.

遂與公子俱逃澤中。
And then she, holding the prince in her arms (lit. together with the prince), jumped into a pool.

秦軍見而射之。
The soldiers of Ch'in saw them, and began to shoot at them with arrows.

乳母以身翼蔽著十二矢。
The nurse protected the prince with her body. A dozen arrows hit her.

遂不令中公子。
But in this way she did not allow them to hit the prince.
