魏乳母
The Nurse from the Wei State

<!-- 秦攻魏破之魏公子亡大索不得乃下令魏國日有得公子者賞千金匿者罪至族公子乳母與俱亡或謂乳母曰得公子賞甚重乳母當知公子處盡言之乳母應之日我不知其處雖知之死則死不可以言也凡養人子者生之非務殺之也豈可以見利畏誅之故廢義而行詐哉吾不能生而使公子獨死突遂與公子俱逃澤中秦軍見而射之乳母以身翼蔽著十二矢遂不令中公子
The Ch'in State attacked the Wei State and destroyed it. The heir-apparent of the prince of Wei disappeared, and in spite of all efforts (lit. big searches) could not be found. Then the following order was issued throughout the Wei State: "He who will find the heir-apparent will be rewarded with one thousand ounces of silver. He who hides him will be punished with all his clan (lit. punishment reaches the clan)." The nurse of the young prince had fled (together) with him. Someone told her, "There is a big reward for finding the prince. You must know the place (of his refuge). Why not tell it?" "I do not know it," replied the nurse, "should I know it, even if I had to die I could not tell it. One who nurses another person's child takes care of his life, and by no means must let him die. How could I for cupidity and for dread of death (lit. because I see the interest and am afraid of death) neglect my duty and commit treachery! I cannot remain alive and let the prince die alone" And then she, holding the prince in her arms (lit. together with the prince), jumped into a pool. The soldiers of Ch'in saw them, and began to shoot at them with arrows. The nurse protected the prince with her body. A dozen arrows hit her, but in this way she did not allow them to hit the prince. -->
