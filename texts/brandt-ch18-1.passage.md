聊齋誌異 妖術(續)
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Magical Arts (continued).

意欲就枕。忽聞窗隙窣窣有聲。急視之。一小人荷戈入。及地。則高如人。
He was planning to lie down, when suddenly he heard a rustling sound in a crack of a window. Quickly he looked, and a small person bearing a spear upon his shoulder entered. The moment he touched the ground, he became as tall as a man.

公捉劍起。急擊之。飄空未中。遂遽小。復尋窗隙。意欲遁出。
Yü seized his sword, jumped up and at once struck at him, but missed his mark and (his sword) only whirled in the air. (The person) then suddenly shrank down and sought again for the window crack intending to escape.

公疾斫之。應手而倒。燭之。則紙人已腰斷矣。
Yi hastily struck him, and he went down under his blows. Turning the light on it (he saw) that it was a paper man cut in two at the waist.

公不敢臥。又坐待之。踰時一物穿窗入。怪獰如鬼。
Yü did not dare to lie down but sat and waited. Some time passed, when something came boring through the window, hideously ugly like a demon.

纔及地。急擊之。斷而爲兩。皆蠕動。恐其復起。又連擊之。
The moment it reached the ground, he quickly struck it and cut it in two. Both pieces wriggled like a worm. Fearing that it might get up again, he struck several successive blows.

劍劍皆中。其聲不耎。審視。則土偶。片片已碎。
Stroke after stroke, all blows told, and their sound was hard. On close inspection (he found) it was a clay idol cut in slices.

於是移坐窗下。目注隙中。久之。聞窗外如牛喘。
After this he moved his seat under the window, with his eyes fixed upon the crack. After some time, he heard outside. the window (a sound) like the breathing of an ox.

有物推窗櫺。房壁震搖。其勢欲傾。公懼覆壓。計不如出而鬪之。
Something pushed against the window frame, and the walls of the building trembled as if they were going to fall. Yü was afraid of being crushed (under them) and thought it was better to go outside and fight the thing.

途砉然脫扃。奔而出。見一巨鬼。高與簷齊。
With a crash he tore off the bolt and jumped out. There he saw a huge demon as high as the eaves of the roof.

昏月中。見其面黑如煤。眼閃爍有黃光。上無衣。下無履。手弓而腰矢。
In the dim light of the moon he saw that its face was as black as coal, and its eyes were flashing with a yellow light. There were no clothes on the upper part of its body nor shoes on its feet. It was holding a bow in its hand, and some arrows were fastened at its waist.
