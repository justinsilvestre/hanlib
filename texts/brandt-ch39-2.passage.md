The expression `慘深風木` is based on the following line of the famous poet Han-yü (韓愈) of the T'ang dynasty:

`樹欲靜而風不息。 子欲養而親不在。 皋魚增感`

"Though the tree may desire to rest, the wind will not cease. Though a son may desire to care for his parents, they are no longer present. Kao-Yü i(n say-ing this) became more affected (by grief)."

Kao-yü (皋魚)was a man whom Confucius one day saw weeping by the roadside. When Confucius asked him about the reason of his grief, he explained that he had suffered three great losses: loss of parents, loss of hope, loss of friends (vid. Ch. Q, p. 641,-2).

The expression `泣咏蓼莪` is taken from the following line of the history of the Chin (晉) dynasty:

`王哀哀父之死。門人因廢蓼莪篇`

"Wang-p'ou lamented the death of his father, so his disciples omitted the ode "Lu-o" (vid. Ch. Q., p. 643,-2).


Wang-p'ou (3rd century A.D.) was a man of the Chin (晉) dynasty. He is ranked as one of the 24 examples of filial piety. He lived in retirement taking pupils, and used to lean against a pine-tree near the grave of his parents to give vent to his grief, until his tears caused the tree to decay. His mother was always very much afraid of thunder; accordingly after her death, whenever it thundered, he would run out to her grave and cry out, "I am near you". On reading the ode referred to he always wept.
