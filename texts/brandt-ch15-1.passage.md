聊齋誌異 種梨
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Planting a Pear-tree.

有鄉人貨梨於市。頗甘芳。價騰貴。
A peasant was selling pears in the market-place. They were very sweet and fragrant, (but) the price was very high.

有道士破巾絮衣丐於車前。
A Taoist priest in a ragged cap and coarse garments was begging before the cart.

鄉人咄之而不去。
The peasant shouted at him (to get away), but he would not go.

鄉人怒。加以叱罵。
The peasant became angry and reviled him.

道士曰。一車數百顆。老衲止丐其一。
The priest said, "On your cart you have several hundred pears, and I only ask for one.

於居士亦無大損。何怒爲。
It would be no great loss to you. Why then are you angry?"

觀者勸置劣者一枚令去。鄉人執不肯。
The onlookers urged the peasant to get rid of an inferior pear and let him go. But the peasant was obstinate and refused.

肆中傭保者.見喋聒不堪。遂出錢市一枚.付道士。
The shopmen in the market-place seeing that the commotion was growing unbearable thereupon contributed a few cash, bought a pear and gave it to the priest.

道士拜謝。謂眾曰。日出家人不解吝惜。
The priest bowed his thanks and said to the crowd, "We monks do not understand stinginess.

我有佳梨。請出供客。
I have here a very fine pear, let me present it to you."

或曰。既有之。何不自食。
Somebody remarked, "Since you have it, why do you not eat it yourself?

曰。吾特需此核。作種。
"I particularly wanted the seeds to plant them," he replied.

於是掬梨大㗖且盡。把核於手。解肩上鑱。坎地上深數寸。納之而覆以土。
Thereupon he seized the pear in both hands, took a large bite and finished it. He took the seeds in his hand, unfastened the pick from his shoulder, dug a hole several inches deep and put the seeds in, covering them over with earth.

向市人索湯。沃湯。
He (then) demanded of the market people some hot water with which to water (the seeds).

好事者於臨路店索得沸瀋。
Willing helpers fetched some boiled water from a neighbouring roadside inn.

(未完)
