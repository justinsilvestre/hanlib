### THE FINAL PARTICLES (`歇語字`)

The Wenli-style abounds with so called final particles. These particles usually have no individual meaning, and are used only to show the end of a clause, a pause or a respite in a sentence.

These particles are:

<center>Single: `也` `焉` `焉` `耳` `爾` `夫` `已`</center>

<center>Compound: `也已` `已矣` `矣夫` `已夫` `耳矣` `云爾` `而已` `而已矣` `也已矣` `已矣夫`</center>

Of these particles 也 and 矣 are most frequently used, and the way of their use is so much alike that it is very difficult to establish a definite rule when one of the two is to be used. or when the other. The explanations given on this subject by the Chinese teachers are very vague and unconvincing (examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10).

也 is often used in the middle of sentences. at the end of correlated clauses and also after individual words or expressions giving emphasis to them (ex. 5, 6, 7, 8, 32, 38).

焉 is very similar to 也, but comparatively less used. Like 也, it is found often at the end of correlated clauses (ex. 4, 11, 12, 14, 25, 26).

焉 is also used in combination with the interrogative par ticles to complete interrogative clauses (see less. XXIII, grammatical section, ex. 7).

耳 and 爾, besides playing the part of final particles, at the same time mean: "simply", "only" (ex. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).

夫 as a final particle has an exclamatory force giving a strong emphasis to the preceding sentence. (ex. 21, 22).

已 gives a strong emphasis to the previous assertion (ex. 23).

也已 and 已矣 greatly emphasize the preceding sentence, "yes," "indeed" (ex. 24, 25, 26, 27).

矣夫 has an exclamatory force (ex. 28, 29, 30).

已夫 gives emphasis to the preceding assertion (ex. 31).

耳矣 and 云爾, like 耳 and 爾 mean: "simply", "only" (ex. 32, 33, 34).

而已 and 而已矣 impart to the sentence a shade of exclusiveness: "only", "nothing more", "that is all" (ex. 35, 36, 37, 38).

也已矣 gives a strong emphasis to the preceding statement (ex. 39, 40, 41).

已矣夫 has a force of exclamation of grief: "all over!" "alas!" (see 已矣乎, less XXII, grammatical section, ex. 11, 12).
