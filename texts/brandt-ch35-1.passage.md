國會政治之危險
The Danger for the Parliamentary System.

目下對於中國政體。議論紛紜。莫衷一是。惟均以國會政治爲中心。
At present the discussions about the governmental system in China are endless, and there is no agreement as to any course to follow. Still the parliamentary government is the heart (of all these discussions).

然國會政治。爲歐洲政治之產物。中國不過假之以資中國政治之運用而已。
The parliamentary system is but a product of European governmental systems, and China merely borrowed it to help in the carrying out of her own government.

然而發達於歐洲之國會政治。究竟能否適用於中國。尙屬一大疑問。
But can a parliamentary form of government which has grown up in Europe be suitable to the needs of China? That is a big question indeed.

此雖尙在初期之試驗中。不易斷其適否。
Inasmuch as the parliamentary system is as yet in the beginning of an experiment, it is not easy to decide whether it will be suitable or not.

然國會政治。在本產地之歐洲。目下果呈何種狀態乎。
But what is the condition of this system now in Europe, the land of its origin?

此實最有興趣之問題。
This is a very interesting question.

茲關於國會政治。姑先究其在該出產地之英國。果作何種狀態。
With respect to the parliamentary system let us first study it in its birthplace--England. What is the situation there?

蓋自歐戰以後。歐洲政治之敵。存於由民衆而來之過激主義。社會主義與其取階級戰爭之形式。
Since the European war, the enemies of European governmental systems have been radicalism and socialism which have both sprung up from the common people, together with a form of class struggle adopted by both these systems.
