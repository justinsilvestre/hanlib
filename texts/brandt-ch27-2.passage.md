一學生致老師信
A Student's Letter to His Teacher

夫子大人尊鑒。敬啟者學生。
To the Honorable Teacher, respectfully, from your student.

昨晚自學堂回家。途遇急雨。衣服盡溼。
Last night, I was returning home from school. On the way, I encountered a sudden rainstorm, and my clothes were completely soaked.

今日早起。頭目暈眩。殊覺不適。
This morning, I woke up early with a dizziness in my head and eyes, feeling quite unwell.

想係感受寒氣所致。
I think it may have something to do with the effects of the cold air.

承家慈之命。在家少息。俟病稍愈。即當赴校補課。
I have received orders from my mother to stay at home and have a little rest. As soon as I've somewhat recovered from my illness, I will head to school to make up for the missed lessons.

用特修函請假。
I am writing this letter specially to request a leave of absence.

伏祈鑒察。
I humbly implore your understanding and approval.

敬請鈞安。
With respectful regards,

學生 某某謹上 日月。
Student [Name] respectfully submits this letter on [Date].
