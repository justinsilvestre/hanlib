美國邀請德國加入華約之不當 (續)
The Impropriety of the American Invitation to Germany to Adhere to the Washington Treaty (continued)

查九國條約爲廢除不平等條約之出步。
The Nine-Power Treaty is the first step toward the abolition of the unequal treaties.

德國與中國既訂有平等相互條約。事實上已屬前進一步。若加入九國條約。不啻退後一步。
Since Germany has already entered into an agreement of reciprocal equality with China, she has truly made a step forward. If Germany were now to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty, she would be taking a step backward.

在美國看法。或以九國條約與中國有利無妨邀各國加入。
The American Government might hold the view that inasmuch as the Nine-Power Treaty is beneficial to China, it does not harm to invite more Powers to adhere to it.

耶然國際間協約。加入與否。須以應否加入爲先決問題。
But, before adherence to any international agreement the preliminary question to be decided is whether it is proper to adhere or not.

九國條約用意在限制與約各國在中國要求特殊權利。
The purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty is to restrict the Treaty Powers in their demands for special rights and interests in China.

中德邦交既處於平等地位。德國無加入之必要。
As the Chinese-German relations have been placed on an equal footing, it is unnecessary for Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty at all.

譬如關稅法權條約議決案。美國邀請各國加入時。均會與中國接洽。
With reference to the resolutions of the Treaty in connection with the customs duties and (consular) jurisdiction, every time, when the American Government invited the adherence of the other Powers to them, it had previously discussed these matters with the Chinese Government.

今美國邀請德國加入。事前並未與中國相商。
This time, when the American Government invited Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty, there was no previous discussion of this question with the Chinese Government.

再袖繹九國條約第八條所謂未簽字各國。只指有不平等舊約之國而言。其已訂有平等條約者。本無關係。
Besides, the non-signatory Powers referred to in Article VIII of the Nine Power Treaty could only mean those Powers which have had unequal treaties with China. With those which have already concluded agreements of reciprocal equality with her it has absolutely nothing to do, and, naturally, those Powers do not belong to that category.

故美國此次邀請德國加入九國條約。不特與中德協定大有違背。且與該約第八條之規定顯有未合。
The invitation by the American Government to Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty runs, therefore, counter not only to the Sino-German Agreement, but also obviously to the provisions of Article VIII of the said Treaty.

聞我政府已向柏林華盛頓兩處嚴重交涉。
It is known that the Chinese Government has already made vigorous protests to the Governments at Berlin and Washington.

無論如何。中國人民對於平等相互條約之國家。欲爲退一步之行動。決難承認也。
Whatever may happen, the Chinese people will be opposed to any retrogressive step by those Powers which have already concluded agreements of reciprocal equality with China.
