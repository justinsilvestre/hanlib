中國與列強對於修改條約之心理 (續)
The Attitude of China and the Powers towards the Revision of Treaties (continued).

自列强方面觀之。凡與中國有關係之強國。均以中國須先實地履行其條約上所規定之責任。爲修改不平等條約之先行條件。
From the point of view of the Powers, all interested countries consider China's fulfillment of the obligations fixed by those treaties as preliminary conditions for the revision of the unequal treaties.

且一切修改之程序。及彼此所應負之責任。亦宜以華盛頓會議所規定者爲標準。
Moreover both the procedure in making this revision and the obligations to be taken up mutually should be in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Conference.

換而言之。實列强欲以不能取消不平等條約之責加諸中國人之身。
In other words, the Powers wish to put responsibility for not abolishing the unequal treaties upon the Chinese.

謂中國在國際上實有與各國享受平等待遇之資格。但所以不能者。蓋由中國自取之也。
Saying that in international relations China really has the qualifications for enjoying equal treatment with the other nations; but the fact that she is unable to enjoy it rests with China herself.

關於取消治外法權一項。各國之覆文。頗不無相當之理由。
In connection with the abolition of extraterritoriality there are very reasonable arguments in the reply of the Powers.

彼云當一九零二。二九零三年締結通商條約之時。彼已表示願放棄治外法權之意。
They say that in 1902 and 1903, when the Treaty of Commerce was concluded, they had already expressed their intention to give up extraterritoriality.

倘中國之法律狀況。與執行辦法。皆可以使彼等滿意。則領事裁判權固早已廢棄矣。
And if the conditions of the Chinese laws and the procedure of the execution had been such as to satisfy them, they would have long ago abandoned consular jurisdiction.
