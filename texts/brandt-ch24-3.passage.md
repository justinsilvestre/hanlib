### THE PREPOSITIONAL PARTICLES.

So called prepositional particles play the same part in the Wen-li style as prepositions in the European languages. They are very numerous, and the following are the most important of them:

#### Used before the obiect

- `於`, `于` in; at; on; to; for; by, then.
- `爲` because of; for; by.
- `自` from.
- `從` from; by; through; since.
- `由` from; by; because of.
- `諸` at; on; in; to; about.
- `乎` in; at; from; than.
- `以` by; through; with.
- `以` a sign of the object.
- `至` to; at; up to; till.
- `用` by; with; from.
- `與` with; for; to.
- `將` a sign of the object.
- `被` by.
- `代` in place of; on behalf of.
- `按` in accordance with.
- `向` toward; to.
- `同` with; together with.
- `距` from; at a distance from.
- `離` from.
- `在` at; on; in.

#### Used after the object

- `內` within; in; among.
- `外` without; beyond; outside.
- `下` below; beneath; under.
- `中` within; in; among.
- `間` during; in; among.
- `前` before; in front of.
- `上` on; above; upon.
- `後` behind; after.
- `旁` near; by; beside.

**Note 1**. The particles `與` and `以` as a sign of the object sometimes are used without the object leaving the latter to be surmised (see lesson XXV, gram. section, ex. 8, 9, 18, 19, 20).

**Note 2**. The particle `以` sometimes is used after the object (see lesson XXV, gr. section, ex. 3).

**Note 3**. The prepositional particles used after the object sometimes are combined with `於` put before the object (see lesson XXV, gr. section, ex. 39, 41, 47, 53).
