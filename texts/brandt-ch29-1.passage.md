THE ATTITUDE OF CHINA AND THE POWERS TOWARDS THE REVISION OF TREATIES (continued). During a period of more than twenty years China had not been able to get rid of the malpractices of her judicial system, SO that (所以) there was no way (無從) to start talk- ing(談起) about the abolition of extraterritoriality. The Powers, with the object(爲……………起見) of fulfilling what they had previously promised (初言), in accordance with the provisions of the 5th resolution of the Washington Conference, are going () to despatch to China a (special) commission which shall investigate the (present) status of the Chinese judicial system and formulate a report. By this (i) the interested countries may be able (得以) to decide whether they should proceed (with extraterritoriality) or not, and what scheme should be followed in proceeding with it or abolishing it. It can be seen from this that the Powers all sympathize with the Chinese demands, and in case case(例) China should some day improve her judicial system, it would be a guarantee of the abolition of special rights. The Powers then would be certainly (白) glad to comply with (China's) demands (lit. to obey the command) and would not raise any objection.

361 Now when the Powers have already spoken in such a sincere and honest way, should China still insist (固持)on the immed- iate abolition of extraterritoriality, it would not be fair from the point of view(觀之) of both (兩方面) reason and actual conditions. The Chinese must use all their efforts to reform their judicial system in order to be ready for the coming(發現) of the investigating commission, and thus (E) they can com- plete all preliminary conditions for the abolition of extrater- ritoriality. As for the position of international equality, it would come then of itself.

中國與列強對於修改條約之心理 (續)
The Attitude of China and the Powers towards the Revision of Treaties (continued).

二十餘年。中國尙不能改革一切司法行政之弊端。所以廢棄治外法權一事。亦無從談起。
During a period of more than twenty years China had not been able to get rid of the malpractices of her judicial system, so that there was no way to start talking about the abolition of extraterritoriality.

列國爲實踐其初言起見。將遵照華會第五議決案之規定。派遣委員會來華。調查中國司法行政之狀況。開具報告。
The Powers, with the object of fulfilling what they had previously promised, in accordance with the provisions of the 5th resolution of the Washington Conference, are going to despatch to China a (special) commission which shall investigate the (present) status of the Chinese judicial system and formulate a report.

使有關係各國政府得以審核領事裁判權之應否進行。及如何進行放棄之策。
By this, the interested countries may be able to decide whether they should proceed with extraterritoriality or not, and what scheme should be followed in proceeding with it or abolishing it.

由此可見各有關係國。皆己同情於中國之要求矣。便中國之司法行政。一旦改良。可爲放棄該特權之保障。
It can be seen from this that the Powers all sympathize with the Chinese demands, and in case China should some day improve her judicial system, it would be a guarantee of the abolition of special rights.

彼自樂於從命。絕無反抗之意也。
The Powers then would be certainly glad to comply with China's demands and would not raise any objection.

列強對於中國既發此誠懇坦率之言。中國若仍固持其立刻廢棄治外法權之主張。以情理現勢兩方面觀之。均有所未當也。
Now when the Powers have already spoken in such a sincere and honest way, should China still insist on the immediate abolition of extraterritoriality, it would not be fair from the point of view of both reason and actual conditions.

中國人宜用其全力以改革其司法行政。以待國際調查委員會之發現。庶乎可以成就一切廢棄治外法權之先行條件。
The Chinese must use all their efforts to reform their judicial system in order to be ready for the coming of the investigating commission, and thus they can complete all preliminary conditions for the abolition of extraterritoriality.

國際間地位之平等。當有不期然而然之勢矣。
As for the position of international equality, it would come then of itself.
