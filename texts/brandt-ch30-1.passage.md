美國邀請德國加入華約之不當
The Impropriety of the American Invitation to Germany to Adhere to the Washington Treaty.

據外交界消息。關於德國擬加入華會九國條約一節。我國當局業分向德美兩國政府聲明。德國在華業經放棄之特權利益。不能適用九國條約之規定。
According to information from the diplomatic circles, with reference to Germany's adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty concluded at the Washington Conference, the Chinese Government declared to both the German and American Governments that the provisions embodied in the Nine-Power Treaty are inapplicable to Germany as she has already forfeited her special rights and interests in China.

連日歐美各報。關於此事。亦多有登載。國內外法律學者。多引爲研究之資料。近有著名國際法學專家某氏對於此事會爲分割式之批評。其談話如下。
For several days this question has been given publicity in the European and American papers, and the Chinese and foreign jurists have used it as material for study. A well known (Chinese) authority on international law has recently made the following analytical comment in reference to this question:

自一九二二三年我國參與華府會議後。國人對於美國莫不表示好感。蓋以華會所訂九國間關於中國事件之條約。意在予中國祛除舊約束縛之機會。俾中國得以自由發展。
"Since China's participation in the Washington Conference in 1922, the Chinese people have come to cherish friendly sentiments toward the United States, mainly for the reason that the Nine-Power Treaty, concluded at the Washington Conference concerning affairs in China, was designed to afford her opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the old treaties in order that she might get freedom for natural development.

其中雖未能盡滿吾人之希望。而舊約之失。藉此修正。爲漸次解除束縛之初步。美人如此主持正義。至可欽佩。
Although this was not sufficient to satisfy our people's expectations completely, it might still lead to the correction of the mistakes made in the old treaties and serve as the preliminary step to the gradual loosening of the fetters. For this stand for justice we greatly respect the American people.

不謂柏林電信傳來。美國忽有邀請德國加入華盛頓九國條約。實出吾人意料之外。
But we are quite surprised at the telegraphic report from Berlin to the effect that the United States has unexpectedly invited Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington.
