## Grammatical section

### 轉折字 The adversative particles.

The adversative particles connect individual words or sentences one of which is contrasted with, or set against, another. This kind of structure is very similar to so called adversative coordinate conjunctions, and the adversative particles very much correspond to the expressions: _but_, _still_, _yet_, _however_ etc.

These particles are:

<center>`而` `乃` `猶` `故` `會` `然` `然而` `顧` `夫`</center>
