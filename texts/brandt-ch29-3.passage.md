### INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES.

#### The particle `所`

The particle `所` is used in the following ways:

1. Used as a noun `所` means: "a place" (ex. 1, 2, 3).
2. The combination of "That which" `所` with verbs forms adjective clauses: "those who" (ex. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
3. The combination `所`...`者` forms:
   - a) adjective clauses: "Those who" (ex. 19).
   - b) adjective clauses: "That which" (ex. 20; also lesson XXVIII, grammatical section， ex. 37, 38, 39, 41, 42).
   - c) verbal nouns (ex. 21; also lesson XXVIII, grammatical section, ex. 43, 44).
4. `所` is often used in combination with `有`. The meaning of this combination depends on the place it occupies in the sentence. When `所有` is placed at the end of a sentence, `所` forms a kind of adjective clause where `有` means: "to have" (ex. 24, 25; also lesson XII, 2, A, note b). Being put before a noun (in singular or in plural) `所有` simply gives an emphasis to it, and is equivalent to the definite article "the" or sometimes to "all the" (ex. 22, 23; also lesson XII, 2, A, note b).
5. The combination `爲` or `被`...`所` with a verb following immediately after `所` forms a passive structure (ex. 26, 27, 28, 29).

**Note.** About the combination `所以` vid. lesson XXVI, grammatical section.
