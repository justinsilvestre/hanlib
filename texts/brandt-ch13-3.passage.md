吳少孺子諫伐楚
Shao-ju-tzu of the Wu State dissuades attacking Ch'u

吳王欲伐荆。告其左右。有敢諫者死。
The prince of the Wu State wished to attack the Ch'u State and said to those who were round him, "If anybody dares to admonish me, that man shall die".

舍人有少孺子者。欲諫不敢。則懷丸操彈。游於後園。露沾其衣。如是者三旦。
Among the courtiers there was one named Shao-ju-tzu. He wished to admonish the prince, but did not dare. Therefore he took a crossbow and some pellets and went to takee a walk in the back garden, where he got his dress all moistened with dew. He did thus three days.

吳王曰。子來何苦沾衣如此。
The prince asked him, "Why do you come with your dress so moistened?"

對曰。園中有樹。其上有蠟。蟬高居。悲鳴飲露。不知螳螂在其後也。螳螂委身曲附欲取蟬。而不知黄雀在其旁也。黄雀延頸欲啄螳螂。而不知彈丸在其下也。此三者。皆務欲得其前利。而不顧其後之有患也。
"There is a tree in the garden", he replied, "with a cicada upon it. The cicada is sitting very high up. It chirps mournfully and drinks dew not knowing that there is a mantis behind it. The mantis lies in ambush wishing to catch the cicada, and not knowing that an oriole is beside it. The oriole stretches out its neck trying to peck the mantis not knowing that a crossbow and pellets are below. Those three earnestly wish to take advantage of what is before them and do not realize the evil that is behind."

吳王曰。善哉。乃罷其兵。
"Good", said the prince, and stopped his troops.
