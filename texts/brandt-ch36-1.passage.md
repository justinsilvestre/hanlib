國會政治之危險 (續)
The Danger for the Parliamentary System (continued)

歐洲大陸諸國。多已為社會主義所佔領。唯英國尙能完全維持其戰前之代議政治。然此次之大罷工。全爲社會主義者假工錢問題而爲革命的挑戰。
Most of the continental countries of Europe have taken to socialism. Only England has been able to preserve completely her pre-war representative government. But the present great strike is a challenge to revolution under pretense of question of wages.

即英國之代議政治。本爲支持歐洲代議政體之金城湯池。今亦將爲社會主義所陷落。歐洲之代議政治。不能不大受打擊。或云過激主義。在英國不過爲一種杞憂而已。
The parliamentary government of England was a stronghold of the European representative form of government. Now it is in danger of being overthrown by socialism. In that case the European representative government would be seriously affected. Some people say that radicalism in England is but a false alarm.

何則。蓋英國勞動黨。决不至使共產主義者。在黨內跋扈故也。雖然。保守黨對於蟠居黨內之頑迷派。能否抑制之使不至趨於法西斯起主義。不能不爲一疑問也。
Why so? It is because the English labor party will tnever allow the communists within their ranks to resort to violence. Nevertheless it is still a question whether the conservative party will be able to restrain the reactionary elements of the party so that they do not run to fascism.

故英國雖無爲共產主義政治之憂。然恐有爲義國的獨裁政治之處。其影響於國會政治。則一也。
Therefore, although England may have no anxiety concerning communistic rule (of the country), still there is for her danger of a dictatorial government like that of Italy. It would also affect the parliamentary system.
