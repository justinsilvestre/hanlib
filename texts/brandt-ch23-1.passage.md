聊齋誌異 考城隍
Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Examination for the Post of Guardian God

予姊夫之祖。宋公。諱羲。邑廪生。
My eldest sister's husband's grandfather, the late Mr. Sung-Tao, was a salaried licentiate in (our) city.

一日病臥。見吏持牒。牽白顚馬來云。請赴試。
One day while lying ill, he saw an official servant with a document, leading a horse with a white forehead, approach him with a message that he was summoned to the examination.

公言文宗未臨。何遽得考。
Sung said, "The provincial examiner has not yet arrived. Why should I hurry to be examined?"

吏不言。但敦促之。
The messenger did not reply, but pressed him (to go).

公力疾乘馬從去。路甚生疏。至一城郭。如王者都。
Sung overcame his sickness, got on the horse, and followed after. The road was quite strange. They reached a city resembling the capital of a prince.

移時入府廨。宮室壯麗。上坐十餘官。都不知何人。惟關壯繆可識。
They shortly entered a palace, the buildings of which were very beautiful and imposing. Ten or more officials were seated at the upper end, all strangers to him, except Kuan-Chuang-mu whom he recognized.

簷下設几墩各二。先有一秀才坐其末。公便與連肩。
Below, under the eaves, were put two tables and two chairs. There was a graduate already seated at the end. Sung then sat down shoulder to shoulder with him.

几上各有筆札。俄題紙飛下。視之八字云。
Writing materials were prepared on the tables, and a piece of paper with a theme on it fluttered down from above. Looking at it, they saw the eight following words.

一人二人。有心無心。
"One man; two men. With intention; without intention."

二公文成。呈殿上。公文中有云。
When they both finished their essays, they passed them up. In Sung's essay, there was the following passage.

有心爲善。雖善不賞。無心爲惡。雖惡不罰。
"For intended good, although it is good, there is no reward. For unintended wrong, although it is wrong, there is no punishment."

諸神傳贊不已。召公上。諭曰。河南缺一城隍。君稱其職。
It was unanimously praised as it was circulated among the deities, and Sung was summoned into their presence and thus ordered. "Honan lacks a Guardian God. You are designated to this post."
