A 公使致外交總長函

逕啟者。前經面談各節俱係緊要事件。本公使恐言語之間或有誤會之處茲將。前日互談各事。
The various subjects we discussed together recently, all concerned matters of great importance. I feared lest there might be some misunderstanding in our conversation, and (therefore) have composed a memorandum of the subjects about which we talked.

另繕節略一紙途上。即請貴總長查閱其間。有無舛誤之處即
I beg to send it herewith to Your Excellency and to ask you to examine it and to see if there be any mistakes therein.

希見覆可也。此達順頌日祉。
Hoping that you will favor me with your reply, I avail myself, etc.
