荆宣王問羣臣
Prince Hsuan of the Ch'u State asks his Ministers

荆宣王問羣臣曰。吾聞北方之畏昭奚恤也。果誠何如。
(One day) prince Hsüan of Ch'u said to his ministers, "I have heard that the northerners (lit. the northern regions) are afraid of Chao-hsi-hsü. What is the reason for it?"

羣臣莫對。江一對曰。虎求百獸而食之。得狐。狐曰。子無敢食我也。天帝使我長百獸。今子食我。是逆天帝命也。予以我爲不信。我爲子先行。子隨我後。觀巨獸之見我。而敢不走平。
The ministers could not reply. (Then) Chiang-i said," (Once upon a time) a tiger went out in quest of prey and caught a fox. "You will not dare to eat me", said the fox," (because) God has made me lord of all the beasts. Now if you eat me, you will disobey the order of God. If you do not believe me. I will walk on ahead of you, and you will follow me, and then you shall see whether the beasts dare do other than run away as soon as they see me."

虎以爲然。故遂與之行。獸見之皆老虎不知獸。畏已而走。也以爲畏狐也今。
The tiger agreed and went with the fox. All the beasts, when they saw them, ran away (in terror). But the tiger did not know that the beasts were afraid of him, and thought that it was the fox they feared.

王之地五千里。帶甲百萬。而專屬之昭奚恤。故北方之畏昭奚恤也。其實畏王之甲兵也。猶百獸之畏虎也。
Your Majesty's kingdom (occupies an area) of five thousand square "li", and there are one million soldiers exclusively sub- ordinated to Chao-hsi-hsii. Therefore (although) the northerners are afraid of Chao-hsi-lisi, in reality they are afraid of Your Majesty's troops, just the same as the beasts were afraid of the tiger."
