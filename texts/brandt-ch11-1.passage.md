合力
Unity

人之生也。飛不如禽。走不如獸。而卒爲世界之主者。
Man by nature is unable to fly like the birds, or travel like the wild animals nevertheless he is after all master of the world.

則以人能合衆人之力。以爲力。而禽獸不能故也。
This is because man is able to bring together the powers of mankind as an united force (lit. and to make a force of it), but the birds and animals are not able to do this.

舉世間力之最大者。莫如聯合力。
In the whole world there is no greater force than united force.

如熾炭然。散爲星點。童子得蹴滅之。
It is like burning charcoal which if scattered is merely a spark that a boy can stamp out,

若萃於一爐。則其勢炎炎。不可向邇矣。
but if gathered together in a stove is glowing hot, so that one is unable to draw near to it.

如束箸然。抽其一枝則物小而易折。
Or it is like a bundle of chopsticks. If one is taken out, it is a small thing and easy to break.

苟束數十百枝而爲一。雖勇夫拔劍砍之。亦未必遽斷也。
But if several tens of hundreds are put together in a bunch, even though a strong man draws his two-edged sword and strikes it, he cannot strike it apart with one stroke.

我國人民號稱四萬萬。爲環球各國所不能及。
The people of our country are called "the 400 millions" which number no other country in the world can reach.

使能上下合力。可以雄視五洲。莫之能禦。
If they high and low were able to combine their strength, they would be able to face fearlessly the five continents, and no one could oppose them.

顧屢戰屢敗。割地賠欵。國勢岌岌。若不終日。
And yet as often as we have fought, just so often have we lost. Our territory is cut up, and an indemnity (is imposed on us). The country is in a desperate state, as though she would not see the end of the day.

則以徒有四萬萬人。而不能合四萬萬人之力。故也。
It is because we have 400 million men only in vain being unable to unite their collective (lit. 400 million men's) strength.

嗚呼。可不懼哉。
Alas, is it not dreadful?

嗚呼。可不勉哉。
Alas, is it not imperative to make an effort?
