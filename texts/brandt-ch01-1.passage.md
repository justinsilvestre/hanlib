# a

"Flocked together (upon a) tree (in a) courtyard".

The use of the prepositions "upon" and "in" can be easily deduced from the connection; while in the spoken version of the story the prepositions are clearly indicated:

聚在院內樹上

This simple example demonstrates to what extent the written style differs from the spoken language. The latter created for hearing and having comparatively poor phonetic reserve, must inevitably have recourse to more complicated combinations. The written style, which takes into account the eyesight of the reader, can express any conception in a much shorter and laconical way leaving, the reader to deduce the meaning from the connection or by the aid of various particles which play a very important part in the written language.

# b

The characters 引頸 with the aid of 而 (whose literary meaning here is "and") form a complement to the verb 鳴, answering to the question: "how?" "in what way?"

In what way did the crows caw? "Stretching their necks," or — "with stretched necks".

**Similar examples**.

- `背理而行` to act contrary to right.
- `不思而得` to get without thinking (of it).
- `不嚴而治` to govern without severity.

# c

Here 之 is a pronoun; "them".

# d

In this case 者 gives a participial force to the preceding verb: "singing", or, "those who sing".

**Similar examples**.

- `知者不言。言者不知也。` Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.
- `知之者。不如好之者。` Those who know it (之) (the virtue) are not equal to those who love it.
- `有德者。必有言。有言者。不必有德。` Those who have virtue are certain to be able to speak; those who can speak are not certain to have virtue.

# e

"(Those who sing) are the crows."

In this case the final particle 也 marks the end of the sentence as it usually does.

**Similar examples**.

- `不知其仁也` I do not know that he is benevolent
- `我不信也` I do not believe (it).

Sometimes 也 makes a pause in a sentence, and so gives emphasis to the preceding words, like:

- `學也祿在其中矣` As to learning, (one's) salary may be found therein.
- `耕也餒在其中矣` As to ploughing, hunger is to be found therein.

# f

Here 之 is used to express the possessive case: "man's knowledge and experience".

# g

"much higher than (those of) birds."

**Similar examples**.

- `莫大於天` there is nothing greater than God.
- `水高於岸` the water is higher than the bank.
- `貴於銀` more valuable than silver.
