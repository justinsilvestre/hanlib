美國邀請德國加入華約之不當 (續)
The Impropriety of the American Invitation to Germany to Adhere to the Washington Treaty (continued)

須知中美兩國政府及人民關係。向極親密。故美國在華之商務。蒸
蒸日上。
Owing to intimate and friendly relations between the Governments of China and the United States and between the Chinese and the American people, American trade in China has grown by leaps and bounds.

近年來進步尤速。蓋華人素好和平。富於情感。
This is particularly the case within recent years as a result of the peaceful nature and friendly feelings of the Chinese people.

今美國邀請德國加入九國條約。無異自認華府會議爲各國在華權利支配之結合。美國助華政策爲一種假面具。
Now the invitation by the United States to Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty is nothing else but a confession that the Washington Conference was but an association of the Powers for division of special rights and interests in China, and that the American policy of helping China was a mere pretense.

蓋九國條約僅規定解除中國束縛之普通原則。而中國在中德協約上。己實行此項原則。取得完全之自由。
The Nine-Power Treaty has only fixed general principles for the liberation of China, while in the Sino- German Agreement China has actually carried out these principles and recovered her complete freedom.

今美邀德加入九國條約。不啻表示反對中國之完全自由。而贊成德國加束縛於中國。此不可解也。
The American invitation to Germany to adhere to the Nine-Power Treaty is therefore nothing less than an indication of (America's) opposition to China's recovery of her freedom, and an encouragement to Germany to place China in further bondage. This is really difficult to understand.

美國此舉無異變更其十餘年來助華之政策。而爲牽制中國進步。反對中國恢復自由之國家。主張人道正義者。所不為也。
Such a step on the part of the American Government is tantamount to a complete reversal of the American policy for helping China which was in effect for over ten years, and it places the United States among those Powers which embarrass China's progress and oppose the recovery of her freedom. It is (surely) not the thing for a Power known to be exponent of right and justice to do.

使德國加入九國條約。果成事實。則中德協定無形取消。即中國在德國方面。既得之平等地位。亦將爲美國所破壞矣。
If Germany's adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty becomes a fact, it will amount to nullifying the Sino-German Agreement. Furthermore the international standing of equality which China has obtained by her agreement with Germany will be annulled by the United States.

以前之仁義道德公理正義果何在乎。
What is to become of the humanity, morality, justice, and right boasted of before?

此後華人對美感情必失。感情若失商務上必受極大之影響。
The Americans will surely lose the friendly sentiment of the Chinese people, and their trade in China will undoubtedly be badly affected.

爲美人計。對於此舉不可不審慎考慮也。
In the interest of the Americans themselves the whole matter should be most seriously and carefully reconsidered.
