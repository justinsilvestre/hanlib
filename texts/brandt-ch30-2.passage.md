賀友人新年函
A Letter Congratulating a Friend on the New Year

敬啟者。
I respectfully address you.

梅花香泛。大地春回。瑞雪紛揚。歲華己改。
The fragrance of plum blossoms fills the air. Spring has returned to the land. Auspicious snowflakes fall thickly. Already the seasons have changed before us.

對此春風。益懷{a:舊雨}。恭維某某仁兄大人文社凝祥。
Facing this spring breeze, I am all the more reminded fondly of my old friend. I think with admiration of all your scholarly success and consummate good fortune, So-and-So.

潭第集慶。爲祝爲頌。弟碌碌如常。無善可慰良朋。五中常憶故友。
Your household's accumulated happiness is the object of my prayers and celebration. As for me, I have nothing out of the ordinary going on, as usual. I have no good news to comfort my dear companion. In my heart I often reflect on my old friend.

欲乘元旦以賀歲。難獻栢茗。幸値{b:履端}而修函。聊當{c:椒頌}。
I wish to keep with the spirit of this New Year's Day and offer my congratulations. It would be difficult to offer you the traditional cypress-leaf tea, but I am happy to write you this letter to get the year off to a good start, as my form of a New Year's greeting.

特呈寸楮。用表微忱。
I present you this short letter as a humble token of my feelings.

{d:恭叩新禧}不備。
I respectfully wish you a happy New Year.

弟某某頓首拜。
I, So-and-So, bow to you.
