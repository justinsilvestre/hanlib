## Grammatical section

### INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES.

There are a few particles which are used in many various ways and cannot be classified in any one definite group. They are therefore united into a separate class of individual particles.

These particles are: `以`, `之`, `者`, `所`.

#### The particle `以`

The particle `以` is used in the following senses:

1. Out, from, of (of material of which something is made) (ex. 1, 2, 3).
2. According to, in accordance with (ex. 4, 5, 6, 7).
3. As a sign of the objective case (ex. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Note. In these cases can also be translated: "to take."
4. By, with (as an instrument) (ex. 14. 15, 16, 17).
5. In order to (ex. 18, 19, 20).
6. To think, to consider. In this meaning is seldom used alone (ex. 24, 37), but usually is combined with (ex. 21, 22, 23). (Compare lesson V, I, note d).
7. Because, on account of (ex, 25, 26).
8. To have (ex 27, 28).
9. To use, to employ (ex 29, 30).
10. To do (ex. 31, 42).
11. Although (ex. 32).
12. If (ex. 33).
13. Sometimes `以` indicates the preceding object (ex, 34, 35. 36, 37, 38, 39). (Compare lesson IX, 2, notes a, g, and lesson X, I, note f).
14. Cause, reason (ex. 40, 41).
15. Used alone or joined with `致` means: so that, and so, and thus (ex. 43, 44, 45, 46).
16. Being joined with `所`:
    - a) forms adjective clauses: "that with which (ex. 47, 48, 49, 50, 51).
    - b) means: therefore (ex. 52, 53).
17. And (ex. 54).
18. Or (ex. 55).
19. Being joined with the expressions of place and time forms compound expressions, like: `以上`, `以下`, `以往`, `以後`, `以來`, `以內`, `以外`, (ex. 56, 57, 58, 59, 60).
