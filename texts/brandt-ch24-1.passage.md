<!-- Examination for the Post of Guardian God (continued).
Sung then () realized (what had happened), bowed his
head and wept, saying, "I am highly and unworthily honored
with your commands. How could I dare to refuse?
And
yet (日) my old mother is seventy years old, and there is none
to care for her. I beg of you to permit (me) (to wait) till the
end of her life, and then (1) I will be at your disposal." There
was one among them resembling (係者) an emperor, who com-
manded that they search out his mother's term of life. A long-
haired servant brought in the Book of Life and turning the
leaves over examined it and reported (白) that nine years
still remained for her to live. They were all in a quandary,
but Kuan-Ti said, "Never mind (不妨). Let Chang act in his
place, and after nine years he shall be relieved." And then he
said to Sung, "You ought to proceed at once to your post, but
in consideration of your filial affection, a leave of nine years is
granted to you, after the end of which term you will be again
summoned." He also addressed words of encouragement to
Chang; and (then) they both made their obeisance and stepped
down. The other student took Sung's hand and led him out
into the country. He told him that his name was Chang and he
was from Ch'ang-shan. At parting he presented him with a bit
of verse. I have forgotten what was in it, but there were these
lines (月) in those verses:
"If we have flowers and wine to drink, We will enjoy eternal spring. Without moon, without light The night itself to us is bright."
Sung then got upon his horse and bidding him farewell left. Hav- ing arrived at his village, he became conscious as if waking from a dream. He had been as dead for three days. His mother heard groans in the coffin and helped him out. It was some time before he was able to speak. He asked about Ch'ang-shan, and found there really was a student named Chang who had died that very day.
Nine years later his mother died. When the funeral was
over, Sung performed his washings, went into his room and died.
His wife's parents lived inside the city near the western gate.
They suddenly saw Sung followed by many carriages and horses
with gay trappings and red tasseled bridles (arrive at their
place), enter the hall, make his obeisance and go. They were
all astonished and alarmed, not knowing that he had become
a spirit. They hastened to the village and found that he had
already died.
Sung had made his own records of his experiences, but unfortunately in the confusion and disturbances of those days they were lost. This is only a bare sketch of the story. -->

Strange Stories from the Liao Studio - Examination for the Post of Guardian God (continued)

公方悟。頓首泣曰。辱膺寵命。何敢多辭。
Sung then realized (what had happened), bowed his head and wept, saying, "I am highly and unworthily honored with your commands. How could I dare to refuse?

但老母七旬。奉養無人。請得終其天年。
And yet my old mother is seventy years old, and there is none to care for her. I beg of you to permit (me) (to wait) till the end of her life, and then I will be at your disposal."

惟聽錄用。上一帝王像者。即令稽母壽籍。
There was one among them resembling an emperor, who commanded that they search out his mother's term of life.

有長鬚吏。捧册翻閱一過。白有陽算九年。
A long-haired servant brought in the Book of Life and turning the leaves over examined it and reported that nine years still remained for her to live.

共躊躇間。關帝曰。不妨令張生攝篆。九年瓜代可也。
They were all in a quandary, but Kuan-Ti said, "Never mind. Let Chang act in his place, and after nine years he shall be relieved."

乃謂公應即赴任。今推仁孝之心。給假九年。及期當復相召。
And then he said to Sung, "You ought to proceed at once to your post, but in consideration of your filial affection, a leave of nine years is granted to you, after the end of which term you will be again summoned."

又勉勵秀才數語。二公稽首並下。秀才握手。
He also addressed words of encouragement to Chang; and then they both made their obeisance and stepped down. The other student took Sung's hand and led him out into the country.

途諸郊野。自言。長山張某。以詩贈別。都忘其詞。中有。
He told him that his name was Chang and he was from Ch'ang-shan. At parting he presented him with a bit of verse. I have forgotten what was in it, but there were these lines in those verses:

有花有酒春長在。無月無燈夜自明之句。
"If we have flowers and wine to drink, / We will enjoy eternal spring. / Without moon, without light / The night itself to us is bright."

公既騎乃別而去。及抵里。豁若夢寤。時卒已三日。
Sung then got upon his horse and bidding him farewell left. Having arrived at his village, he became conscious as if waking from a dream. He had been as dead for three days.

母聞棺中呻吟。扶出半日始能語。問之長山果有張生。於是日死矣。
His mother heard groans in the coffin and helped him out. It was some time before he was able to speak. He asked about Ch'ang-shan, and found there really was a student named Chang who had died that very day.

後九年。母果卒。營葬既畢。浣濯入室而沒。
Nine years later his mother died. When the funeral was over, Sung performed his washings, went into his room and died.

其岳家居城中西門內。忽見公鏤膺朱幩。輿馬甚衆。豋其堂。一拜而行。
His wife's parents lived inside the city near the western gate. They suddenly saw Sung followed by many carriages and horses with gay trappings and red tasseled bridles arrive at their place, enter the hall, make his obeisance and go.

相共驚疑。不知其爲神。奔訊鄉中。則已沒完。
They were all astonished and alarmed, not knowing that he had become a spirit. They hastened to the village and found that he had already died.

公有自記小傳。惜亂後無存。此其略耳。
Sung had made his own records of his experiences, but unfortunately in the confusion and disturbances of those days they were lost. This is only a bare sketch of the story.
